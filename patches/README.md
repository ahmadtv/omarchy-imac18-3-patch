# iMac 5K patch — how to use, and the rules that keep you safe

`imac5k-amdgpu-7.2.2.patch` is the complete native-5K stack for the iMac18,3's
internal tiled panel, as one diff against **kernel 7.2.2** source:

1. **Second-tile wake** — DPCD `0x4F1` root-latch pulse that powers up the
   hidden right-tile DP link (community work from
   [drm/amd#4455](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/4455) /
   [mcirsta/linux-imac-5k](https://github.com/mcirsta/linux-imac-5k), rebased
   to 7.2.2 by taprobane99)
2. **Single-display stitch** — presents both 2560×2880 tiles to userspace as
   ONE 5120×2880 output, so Hyprland (or any compositor) works unmodified
   (erik2's commits, hand-ported to 7.2.2)
3. **Genlock fix** — enables the per-frame CRTC reset for the Apple tile pair
   so both halves scan in lockstep (`sync_enabled=1`) and the panel is
   seamless under motion (mr_projects; fills a standing mainline TODO)

Boot parameter once installed: `amdgpu.tiled_stitch=1`

## Installing without a second kernel

```bash
sudo ../scripts/patch-imac5k-amdgpu.sh          # build + swap the amdgpu module
sudo ../scripts/patch-imac5k-amdgpu.sh --restore  # undo everything
```

The script rebuilds **only the amdgpu module** for your *running* kernel and
swaps it in (stock module backed up first). Re-run it after a kernel update.

## The rules

- **RULE 1 — version gate.** The patch is verified against kernel **7.1.x and 7.2.x source** (same diff applies to both).
  The script refuses to run on any other series, because the amdgpu display
  code changes between kernel versions and a mis-applied patch means a broken
  GPU module. When Arch/Omarchy moves to 7.3+, the patch must be **re-ported
  by a human first** — re-running the script is not enough. (Check
  `uname -r` starts with 7.1 or 7.2 before expecting anything.)

- **RULE 2 — test on the USB clone first.** Never run this for the first time
  on your only install. The project keeps a full bootable clone on a USB
  stick for exactly this. If a build ever produces a bad module you get
  software rendering until `--restore` — recoverable, but not fun to discover
  on your daily machine.

- **RULE 3 — the vermagic must match.** The script verifies the built
  kernelrelease equals `uname -r` and refuses otherwise. If it ever refuses,
  that's it working as designed — don't force it.

- **RULE 4 — this is a bridge, not the destination.** The endgame is
  upstreaming (tracked in drm/amd#4455, where the iMac18,3 result and the
  genlock fix have been posted). Once merged into mainline, stock kernels
  will do all of this and these patches retire.

## Known good configuration (verified 2026-09-02, iMac18,3)

- Kernel 7.2.2 + this patch, `amdgpu.tiled_stitch=1`, Omarchy/Hyprland
- Result: genuine 5120×2880, both tiles HBR2×4, 10-bpc, `sync_enabled=1`,
  seamless under motion, zero GPU faults
- Expected quirks: GNOME-keyring popup on a cloned system (benign), YouTube
  4K is CPU-decoded (Polaris has no VP9/AV1 hardware — a silicon limit,
  unrelated to this patch)
